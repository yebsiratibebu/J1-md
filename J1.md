Questions
 # 1 What is fault localization? Provide your answer using at least one bolded phrase using markdown.
 Fault localization typically **involves tracing back from the line of code producing the incorrect output to where the problem actually was.** 


# 2 What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)? Provide your answer using an unordered list in markdown.
- your test are not biased by your code
- writing tests helps you think about how you might write code
- Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system

# 3 Given the example of requirements for generating a password:

- It must have at least one number.
    * valid: it containes numbers 0 -9
    * invalid: does not contain a number
- It must have at least one uppercase letter.
    * valid: if it contains any alphabet that is an uppercase
    * invalid: if the any alpahbed from a-z does not have an uppercase

- It must have at least one lowercase letter.
    * valid : if it contains any aphabed from a -z that is a lowercase
    * invalid: if it contains alpahbets from a-z that does not contain a lowercase

- It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
    * valid: if it does not contain a "gmail" string
    * invalid: if it does contain a "gmail" string

- It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.
    * valid: has an alphabets of letter or  numbers from 0-9 and an underscore
    * invalid: if it has special characters such as an exchlamation point, period, or any sort

What are the input domain paritions for this exercise? Provide your answer using an unordered nested lists in markdown.

# 4 Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional:

if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )
| a > b	| G     | x < y |	predicate outcome   |	clause responsible|
|true   |true   |true   |true                   |  (a>b) & (G) & (x<y)|  
|true   |true   |false  |false                  |    x<y              |
|true   |false  |true   |true                   |    (a>b) & (x<y)    |
|true   |false  |false  |false                  |     x<y             |
|false  |true   |true   | true                  |     (G) & (x<y)     |
|false  |true   |false  | false                 |     (a>b) & (x<y)   |
|false  |false  |true   |false                  |      (a>b) & (G)    |
|false  |false  |false  | false                 |  (a>b) & (G) & (x<y)|


Google how to make a table in markdown, and use a table to represent your results, like we did in class.



# 5 Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?

Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

Path 2: 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7

Path 3: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

Path 4: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

Path 5: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

Path 6: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

This is a finite set.

# 6 What benefit does mutation testing offer over other testing methods discussed in class? Use a link in markdown to link to the definition of mutation testing we have in our lecture notes from today.

mutating the syntactic structures of the code to generate bugs automatically

# 7 Finish the in-class exercise for finding the fault in the checkCode method.
